# CS230
This is the final project submission for CS230 - Operating Platforms.

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room. The software they wanted made was a game called Draw It or Lose It. It is created for Android systems and they wanted to add cross-platform functionality so that the game ran on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I successfully went through and added the functions that were requested, using the FIXME comments as a guide for what work needed to be done.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I really liked the design document because I'm a pretty visual learner and the want it was laid out was very intuitive for me.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I cannot think of any areas that can be improved since all of the features were built.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To be honest, I looked at the needs that were listed in the request and researched ways to accomplish them, taking into account cost effectiveness and user friendliness of each one. Ensuring the client's needs are met is important when creating softwre for any client as this ensures their happiness. This brings me more business as a developer. This will show subsequent clients that I am able to listen to their needs and meet them to the best of my ability which will bring in more business.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The approach I took was to look at each file and check for errors by running it one function at a time. Once ensuring each error was corrected, I ran the software to ensure it ran as expected. This knowledge can be helpful in the future, when working with code written by someone else that needs the bugs worked out.
